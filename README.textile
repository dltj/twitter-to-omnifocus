.h1 twitter-to-omnifocus

Read the home timeline of a Twitter user and add
the text of any tweets found there to the OmniFocus inbox

.h2 SYNOPSIS
<pre>twitter-to-omnifocus [ configuration_file ]</pre>

.h2 DESCRIPTION
This application pulls the home timeline of the user corresponding to
the consumer key specified in the configuraiton file and adds the text
of tweets found there to the OmniFocus inbox using AppleScript.

.h2 CONFIGURATION FILE
This script looks for a configuration file specified as the first
argument of the script, as ".tweettoOmniFocus.cfg" in the home
directory, or as "tweettoOmniFocus.cfg" in the current working directory
(in that order).

The file consists of configuration directives as key-value pairs
separated by white space. The configuration file is rewritten at each
execution to include additional values (such as the identifier of the
last tweet noticed in the home timeline) necessary for the program to
run. This configuration file must have two lines in it that represent
the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret that you get when you register the
application at <http://dev.twitter.com/apps>.

<pre>    consumer_key      abc123abc123abc123
    consumer_secret   789xyz789xyz789xyz789xyz</pre>

The first time the application runs, you will be prompted to authorize
this application with Twitter and enter a PIN number. When you do that,
two other values -- "access_token" and "access_token_secret" -- will be
written to the configuration file.
